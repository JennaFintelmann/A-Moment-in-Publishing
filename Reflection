This project was more frustrating side for me. 
The word <b>“simple”</b> kept being used and I feel as though that was the wrong word to use, as people who are not technologically smart (especially for the means of creating a website and the language behind it) was very hard to wrap my head around. 
I had no idea what I was doing, even with the videos. 
Once I played around with the website and all the buttons, I guess it became a little easier to understand it all. 
But for someone with no prior knowledge of anything to do with creating a website, it was very frustrating. 
Espeically the word choice “simple.” 
All in all, it is cool to see all that hard work and frustration end up as a website, even if it seems very unprofessionally done and such.
Since I had access denied to the “Getting Your Site Up and Running” video, I struggled with the document that was meant to help me navigate the website. 
I couldn’t find the “page” tab  for a few minutes and was ready to throw in the towel, when it finally appeared. 
I swear it showed up out of nowhere, but I most likely overlooked the placement of it or something. 
Overall, the website is cool it see int the end, but it was a very frustrating process to get it to that point.
